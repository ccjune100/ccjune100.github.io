                            2D Game Design Final Project: For this project I was working on making a Berserk style game
                            where the player had three maps to go through until the reached the win screen which was unlocked by killing all
                            the enemies on each map. The enemies were programmed to shoot at and follow the player so it was no easy
                            challenge.

                            Computer Science II Final Project: For Computer Science II, we had to make a menu with 4 different options
                            for sifting through and checking a university roster for faculty and staff, adding faculty/staff, updating
                            student grades, etc.

                                Operating Systens Final Project: For Operating Systems we made a functioning-ish OS in linux that
                                could read, write, delete, and add files.
                                <br></br>

                                other side of the screen and back in one continuous motion in python.
